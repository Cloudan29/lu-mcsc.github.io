Hello everyone! We are throwing another Gaming Social, this time as a fundraiser for the Movember Foundation. Join us for a fun-filled evening on November 23rd 2018 at the Foundry (Cliff Fielding Innovation Center). We ask for a 2$ donation upon entry. These donations will go towards the Movember Foundation. Hope to see you there!
