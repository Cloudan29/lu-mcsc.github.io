The MCSC will be holding another Gaming Social at the Cliff Fielding Innovation Centre in The Foundry, Friday November 23rd running from 7pm until midnight. There is a $2 donation for entry but all proceeds from these fees go to support the Movember Foundation. We'd love to see you all there. Please feel free to bring your own rigs or consoles as we have access to a large number of TV and a great amount of deskspace.
