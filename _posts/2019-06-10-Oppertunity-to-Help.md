Hello, my name is Tobias Mankis. I am a graduate student at Laurentian
University in the Science Communication program. I am conducting
research on the comprehension of online science videos, and I am
inviting you to participate in this study.

The purpose of this study is to understand how different video factors
affect viewer comprehension. Ultimately, this study will serve to
inform and improve the practice of creating science videos for online
audiences.

If you choose to participate, you will be asked to complete a short
entry survey and pre-video comprehension test, view a 5-minute science
video, and then complete a short post-video comprehension test and
exit survey. The entire process should take approximately 15 minutes
to complete.

The entire study takes place online and can be completed at your
leisure at any location of your choosing.

If you would like to participate, please click the applicable link
below to take you to the study. The reason I am asking you to click on
a link based on your day of birth is to randomly assign you to one of
two study groups. All relevant information for your Informed Consent
will be provided to you via the below links before you conduct the
study.

If your birth date is an even number (i.e. June 18th), please click on
